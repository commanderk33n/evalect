The typical flow about how to use evalect is:

2. Once group is created, you can click on the group which takes you to another page where you can manage questions.
3. Create a question by clicking on add new, and you will be provided by these options: Each question will have a type

- Checkbox: Create a question which contains multiple checkboxes with the options that you provide in answer options field. Note that each option should be on a separate line.
- Date:     It takes date as an answer
- Long:     It needs a description as answer. Renders a textarea.
- Numeric:  It takes a number as an answer
- Radio:    It renders set of radio buttons by taking answer options.
- Select:   It renders a dropdown by taking answer options.
- Short:    It takes a string as an answer. Short answer.

4. Once the type is filled, you can optionally fill other details like

- Question text:              What is the question?
- Answer options:             Give options separated by newline for questions of type checkbox, radio buttons or select.
- Answer presence:            Should you mandate answering this question?
- min and max length:         Checks whether answer if in between min and max length. Ignores if blank.
